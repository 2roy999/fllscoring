Introduction:
In the regional games of the FLL, much effort is required from referees and scoring people to record and process scores.
If the scoring requires no effort, more attention can be given to the game/the children.
We aim to develop a software/hardware solution that makes scoring effortless.

Regional games often in places without internet acces or wireless connection.
Scoring using a handheld device (running IoS or Android), 
will allow fast processing of recorded playing field to final scoring.
These scores can then be processed on a PC.
By building a modular system, with well defined communication between modules, 
any inputs can be given either manually or using communication between devices.

User interfaces:
The apearance of the user interface depends on the functionality that is given to the handheld devices and PC.
For now, the assumption is made that the handheld device is used mainly for filling out the score sheet, 
and the PC is used for ranking teams on scores.

Handheld device user interface:
Since the fllscoring system will be used by many people, who will not use it dayly, using the app should be easy.
