# Introduction
In effort to make recording and managing scores as easy and dynamic as possible a simplistic user interface is needed, with a logical flow between different screens and modes of the system. 

This document describes the screens of the application and the flow between them.

**Note:** All terminology is not final, and is bound to change.

# 1. Server/Client/Calculator

The system has three modes:
* Server mode will present the user with a wizard to create and setup the tournament. A five page wizard makes sure the tournament is set up, and the system is ready for use.
* Client mode can connect to an existing server, or use the current device as a server if no network is available for the tournament.
* Score calculator mode is intended for tournaments which work with paper scoring forms. The scorekeeper(s) can use this mode to calculate scores and write them down to the paper scoring forms.

The user will start with a choice between these three.
